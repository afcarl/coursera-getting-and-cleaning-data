## Getting and Cleaning Data Project

This project implements the course project for Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data projected located here: https://class.coursera.org/getdata-015.

### About

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

### Purpose

This script analyzes data collected by the Samsuing Galaxy S smartphone worn by 30 subjects.

It outputs the average values for each measurement for each activity performed by each student.

Those activities can be WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, or LAYING.

### To run this project:

1. Unzip the data in the directory with the R Script (the data should be in UCI HAR Dataset).
2. Execute the R script.
3. It will output the analysis to "tidy-data.txt"

### Attribution

I had some inspiration for the final step of the project -- outputting the means -- from [this project](https://github.com/skahali/run_analysis.R/blob/master/run_analysis.R).
